activities to the end of the project.

## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile is Iterative and incremental approach to project management and software development while Waterfall Linear and sequential approach.

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Projects Where Agile is More Beneficial
Agile is ideal for projects requiring flexibility, continuous feedback, and frequent updates.
Examples:
Software Startups & App Development – Rapidly evolving requirements and user feedback drive iterative improvements.
E-commerce Platforms – Constantly updating features based on user behavior and market trends.
AI & Machine Learning Models – Continuous data refinement and model tuning require an adaptive approach.
Projects Where Waterfall is More Beneficial
Best suited for projects with well-defined requirements, strict regulations, or minimal expected changes.
Examples:
Government and Defense Projects – Compliance with strict regulations requires thorough planning.
Infrastructure & Construction – Fixed planning phases ensure safety and budget control.
Medical Device Software – Requires rigorous testing and regulatory approval before release.

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Methods for Ensuring Quality Assurance in Software Projects
Establish Clear Requirements
Avoid ambiguity by defining detailed functional and non-functional requirements upfront.
Use Automated and Manual Testing
Unit Testing (validate individual components).
Integration Testing (ensure smooth communication between modules).
System Testing (verify complete system functionality).
User Acceptance Testing (UAT) (validate against user needs).
Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
Automate testing and deployment to catch errors early and ensure stable releases.
Code Reviews & Pair Programming
Encourages best coding practices and detects potential issues before merging code.
Adopt Agile Testing Practices
Test-Driven Development (TDD) – Writing tests before coding ensures higher reliability.
Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) – Focuses on user expectations for more effective tests.
Monitor Performance and Security
Regular load testing, security audits, and vulnerability scanning prevent critical failures.
Maintain Proper Documentation
Helps teams understand, debug, and enhance software effectively.

Why Maintaining High Quality Standards is Important
Reduces Bugs & Failures – Minimizes costly post-release fixes.
Enhances User Satisfaction – Leads to higher adoption and trust.
Ensures Security & Compliance – Prevents data breaches and legal risks.
Improves Maintainability – Well-structured code simplifies future updates and scaling
  
## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
Project Scope & Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
How Defining Project Scope Contributes to Success
Clarity & Direction – Outlines project goals, deliverables, and boundaries.
Prevents Scope Creep – Reduces unnecessary changes that can delay progress.
Improves Resource Allocation – Ensures the right budget, time, and personnel are assigned.
Enhances Stakeholder Communication – Aligns expectations among teams and clients.
What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)?
A hierarchical decomposition of a project into smaller, manageable tasks.
Breaks work into phases, deliverables, and tasks, making complex projects easier to execute.
Why is WBS Useful?
Organizes Work Efficiently – Helps assign responsibilities clearly.
Improves Task Estimation – Helps predict time, cost, and effort accurately.
Enhances Progress Tracking – Provides a roadmap for monitoring project milestones.

## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
Benefits of a Detailed Project Schedule & Role of Gantt Charts
Benefits of a Detailed Project Schedule
Sets Clear Deadlines – Defines when tasks should start and finish.
Enhances Coordination – Ensures smooth team collaboration by sequencing tasks properly.
Identifies Critical Paths – Helps prioritize tasks that directly impact project timelines.
Improves Risk Management – Anticipates delays and adjusts schedules accordingly.

How Gantt Charts Assist in Project Scheduling
Visual Representation – Displays project timeline, dependencies, and progress.
Tracks Task Dependencies – Highlights tasks that must be completed before others begin.
Improves Time Management – Helps teams stay on track with deadlines.
Enhances Communication – Provides a clear overview of project status to all stakeholders.

## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
Garbage Collection Billing System: Core Issues & Significance
Core Issues the Software Aims to Address
Manual & Inefficient Billing Processes
Many garbage collection services rely on paper-based or manual record-keeping, leading to errors and inefficiencies.
Delayed or Missed Payments
Lack of automated invoicing results in late payments, revenue loss, and poor financial tracking.
Lack of Transparency & Accountability
Customers and service providers often struggle with disputes over billing, missed collections, or unclear payment records.
Difficulty in Service Tracking
No centralized system to monitor garbage pickup schedules, route optimization, or service completion.
Poor Customer Communication
Customers don’t get timely notifications about billing, overdue payments, or service updates.

Significance to Target Audience
Garbage Collection Companies: Increases efficiency, reduces revenue loss, and improves tracking.
Municipalities & Local Governments: Ensures compliance with waste management regulations and improves public service delivery.
Residents & Businesses: Provides a seamless way to track payments, view service history, and avoid disputes.

## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
